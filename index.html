    <h2><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; color: #999999;">Introduction</span></h2>
    [caption id="attachment_26" align="alignleft" width="223"]<img class="wp-image-26 size-medium" src="https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/chl223/files/2023/03/800px-The_Buccaneers_of_America_1-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300" /> <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">[2] "Frontispiece to 1st edition of <i>Buccaneers of America</i>, 1678"</span>[/caption]<span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">Alexandre Olivier Exquemelin was a 17th century French writer and surgeon. His book, <em>The Buccaneers of America</em>, was first published in Dutch, interpreted in Spanish, and then finally translated to English in 1684. The book contains detailed accounts of Alexandre's personal experiences serving as a surgeon among a crew of buccaneers.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">In <em>The Buccaneers of America</em>, the author takes us on a chronological 4-part journey through each one of his expeditions. He opens <em>Part I </em>with his time spent on the Island of Tortuga and then transitions into the Island of Hispaniola. <em>Part II </em>begins by describing the actions of Francis L'Ollonais while the latter half of <em>Part II </em>as well as <em>Part III </em>focuses primarily on the actions of Sir Henry Morgan. Finally, <em>Part IV </em>closes out the saga with the voyage of Captain Bartholomew Sharp in the South Sea.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">Throughout the article, we will decide whether or not <em>The Buccaneers of America </em>can be examined as a credible primary source. This will be determined by taking into consideration the social and political context in which the book was written, Alexandre Exquemelin's perspective and potential biases, as well the ongoing relevance of the text in contemporary times.</span>
    <h2><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; color: #999999;">History of the Buccaneers</span></h2>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">The name <em>Buccaneer</em> derives from the French term <em>boucan, </em>referring to a method of curing meats. This method was adopted by French settlers in Hispaniola, who then came to be known as <em>Buccaneers</em> after they began engaging in acts of piracy.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">The Buccaneers were a group of pirates and privateers active in the Caribbean during the 17th century. These groups specialized in privateering, raiding, pillaging, and smuggling. During the age of new world exploration and subsequent wartime, the Buccaneers were known to be influenced by the political agendas of the great European powers such as Spain, England, and France. When Buccaneers were employed as Privateers, they received legal authorization to raid enemy ships and settlements for the sake of their home country. This allowed them to operate under a legitimate political cover and forfeit all punishment from their own country.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;"><em>The Buccaneers of America</em> traces the entirety of Alexandre Exquemelin's career as a buccaneer. Although the account is the product of a single author, it is significant to recognize that during his years of service, he had the opportunity to serve under some of the most renowned buccaneer captains of the time period. At the culmination of his last voyage, the author along with rest of the buccaneers are dispersed among several countries. A few years after he arrives in England, his perspective is documented and published in 1678.</span>
    <h2><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; color: #999999;">Exquemelin's Perspective</span></h2>
    [caption id="attachment_31" align="alignright" width="200"]<img class="wp-image-31 size-medium" src="https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/chl223/files/2023/03/exquemelin-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /> <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">[3] "Bust of Exquemelin in Le Jardin des Personnalités, Honfleur"</span>[/caption]<span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">Alexandre Exquemelin composed <em>The Buccaneers of America </em>to document a detailed description of the tactics, customs, and traditions shared by the buccaneers. Additionally, he adds insight to their battles and raids against the Spanish settlements and ships. By bringing <em>the author's</em> perspective into <em>our</em> perspective, we will be able to further analyze the context that prompted him to document his experiences.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">Exquemelin arrived on the island of Tortuga in 1666 under the employment of the French West India Company. While on Tortuga, he was twice sold before becoming an indentured servant to the buccaneers inhabiting the island. He eventually enlisted himself as a surgeon to provide medical assistance to the buccaneers during their raids throughout the Caribbean, and thus remained until 1672.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">While the author was on the island of Tortuga and Hispaniola, he was intrigued by the buccaneers' way of life. He took an interest in the methods the buccaneers used to hunt and navigate, as well as the valor and resourcefulness they displayed in battles against the Spanish.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">Under the command of Captain Francis L'Ollonais, the author experienced firsthand the horrific, yet effective siege tactics of the captain as well as his unwavering command over his loyal men. He provides an in-depth account of a surprise conquest the buccaneers launched on the cities of Maracaibo and Gibraltar. In both instances, the buccaneers killed countless Spaniards in order to plunder and to establish their occupancy of these cities. He remained under L'Ollonais' command until the captain's tragic death.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">As a member of Captain Henry Morgan's crew, the author witnessed the daring raids and ruthless tactics that made Morgan one of the most successful and acclaimed buccaneers of the era. Specifically, he provides a detailed account of the raid on Panama City in 1671, during which Morgan and his forces faced overwhelming odds but ultimately resulted in a victory. Despite the Spanish defense being knowledgeable of the attack as well as having far greater numbers, Morgan's planning and strategic leadership was enough for the buccaneers to overcome their defense. The author also took great note of the fear and respect Morgan's crew had for him, motivating them to follow his command into the dangers of battle.</span>
    <h2><span style="color: #999999; font-size: 18pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Analysis and Retrospective</span></h2>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">Alexandre Exquemelin's perspective, by being a participant in the events in his journal, shapes his portrayal of the experiences he documents. His first-person account provides us with complex details on the buccaneers' actions- details that would otherwise be unretrievable or less accurate from an outside perspective of the same events.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">His portrayal is further affected by being a member of the buccaneers in which he wrote on, as he would likely honor his loyalty and express sympathy to his crew. Contemporary portrayals of the buccaneers and pirates retain a negative connotation as savages yearning only for blood and loot, however his experiences paint them in a different light. The author convinces us through his eyes that the world is a cruel, dangerous place, and the buccaneers needed to adapt and rely on each other in order to survive.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;"><em>The Buccaneers of America </em>contains key takeaways that allow us to get a deeper insight into the world of the buccaneers. Firstly, from the author's encounters on the Island of Tortuga and the Island of Hispaniola, he was able to define the origin of the buccaneer. Furthermore, he describes the evolution of the buccaneer, from French settlers and hunters to an organized community with their own complexities and methods of living. Finally, we learn more about the impact that piracy had on the Caribbean islands, constantly disrupting the economy of the region by targeting the Spanish trade ships and port cities.</span>
    <h2><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; color: #999999;">Conclusion</span></h2>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">When determining the credibility of <em>The Buccaneers of America, </em>we must understand the biases that Alexandre could be subject to. One bias is that he published the book with the intention of publishing it for profit. It is possible that he may have over exaggerated certain events in order to catch the audience's attention in order to sell more copies. Another possible bias is that as a result of documenting his personal experiences, he is influenced by his feelings of loyalty and sympathy for the crew that he lived among. While these biases could have a potential effect on the manner in which he presents his story, he still composes the events in a non-fictional record of events. On the other hand, there remains other complications that must be addressed before truly concluding the credibility of <em>The Buccaneers of America.</em></span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">There are two specific complications that must be brought into context. Before being translated to English, the book was first published in Dutch and then translated to Spanish. This resulted in lossy conversions with misinterpretations of some phrases and incorrect translations of others. Additionally, as the journal wasn't composed until a few years after the author arrived in England, the story may contain inaccurate dates. These complications can skew the historical accuracy of the events described, however as the historical documentation of this specific time period is slim, most dates serve only as estimates for the relative placement of events. </span>
    
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #999999;">Exquemelin's <em>The Buccaneers of </em><i>America </i>is an authentic text that enlightens the reader with valuable information on the era of the buccaneers. It is important to approach the text critically, as the author could have a number of potential biases along with lossy translations or inaccurate dates. This does not diminish the historical events that unfolded in front of the author, rather the reader should hope to retain the valuable insights into the life of a buccaneer. </span>
